### 6.1. Side Challenge - Holiday Hero
The objective is to get the Santa Sleigh up and flying by smashing those notes on the keyboard!
Unfortunately it’s a lonely place there and nobody wants to play with me…

That made me so sad I had to give myself a `single_player_cookie` by the name of `HOHOHO`:

I found myself still in lonely land, so I had to explicitly tell my imaginary friend to join:

Finally me and my [Armadillo](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo_(Zerocalcare)) were able to have some FUN getting that sleigh pumped up to 100%:

#### 6.1.0. I don’t know why
I don’t know why I made this solution so much on the weird side, but I hope you’ll have fun reading it :)
